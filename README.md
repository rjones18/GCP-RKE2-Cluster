# GCP-RKE2-Cluster

In this project, I've successfully orchestrated a RKE2 Kubernetes cluster, leveraging GCP's robust infrastructure to configure three virtual machines: one master node and two worker nodes. The project's backbone is a streamlined Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline, achieved by integrating a GitHub repository with Google Cloud Source Repositories. This setup ensures a smooth development workflow and consistent updates.

Enhancing the reliability of the project, Cloud Build is integrated for the automated deployment of Terraform IAC for the creation of the Virtual Machines/Pipeline. Additionally, three custom bash scripts were crafted to automate the initial configuration of each VM, laying the groundwork for a seamless cluster formation. Security is fortified with the inclusion of Snyk, providing vigilant vulnerability monitoring and maintaining the cluster's defenses against emerging threats.
